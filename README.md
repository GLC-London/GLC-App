The GLC App

## Getting Started
This is the code base for the GLC App for IOS and Android Devices. Anybody is free to contribute to the development of the church.

You can also clone this repository and run "flutter run" on the terminal at the location of the cloned files to get the apk or ipa installed on your Andorid or IOS device.

Thank you and Goodluck.
